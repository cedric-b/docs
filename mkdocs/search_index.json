Because it incorporates HTML5 programming to an unprecedented extent, its usability and design flexibility surpasses all other content management systems that we know of.\n\n\nAll changes in content \u2013 adding, deleting or changing text, images or new page elements \u2013 can be made directly on the page. Just click and type, or drag and drop. No back office. No shuttling back and forth between the back end and a \u201cpreview\u201d page that often fails to match the final page display.\n\n\nBackBee offers what we like to call WYSIWYRG, What You See Is What You Really Get.
