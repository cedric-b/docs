# Introduction

## What is BackBee ?

BackBee is an open-source On-page Editing system (OES). It can be used to create websites with no prior technical knowledge.

**What is an Open-page Editing Site?**

Similar to content management system or CMS, an Open-page Editing Site (OES) is a software application to enter, edit and manage website with one major difference: The back office and front office is merged.

**What’s so interesting about this?**

It's easier and more flexible than your usual CMS. With BackBee's On-page Editing System, you can work directly on the HTML page, the page that's visible to your users. You can drag and drop page elements and move them around as you wish, adding, deleting or changing text, photos or other page elements by simply clicking on the area in question.

The majority of the editorial functions require no back office. BackBee is the first OES to merge back office and front office.

**What’s this means?**

In many content management systems, you have to shuttle between the back office – a utilitarian interface where you input your content – and a “preview” mode. Only then may you  see how the page will look on-line, as your user see it.

BackBee lets you directly do all your inputting and editing on the page that appears to your user. Thus you get an immediate and exact idea of what the final page will look like.

Many of BackBee's features are made possible by the unprecedented level to which it incorporates HTML5.
